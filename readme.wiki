# Lithium Intrusion Detection System Library (li3_ids)

The li3_ids is a port of the phpids Library from phpids.org.

## Setup
Simply embed the library into your Library folder and add it in your bootstrap process.
(e.G.: app/config/bootstrap/libraries.php):

{{{
Library::add('li3_ids');
}}}
then make sure, that you give write access to the ids tmp path. which is
{{{li3_ids/libraries/phpids/lib/IDS/tmp}}}
We will change this folder settings into li3 alike in one of our next releases.

##Info
Currently, it just supports logging into your resources folder.
look into:
{{{
app/resources/tmp/warning.log
}}}

more Features will follow soon.
Ideas: Database Logging, MailService, ImpactLevel mapping to Log-Levels
